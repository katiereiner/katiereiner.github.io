	<h1>Popularity of Javascript in Web Development</h1>
	<p>Javascript was first developed in 1995, that means it is almost as old as the web itself.</p>
	<p>Javascript is very different than programs like HTML or CSS in that javascript has a <strong>brain</strong> and acts as the backbone to these other languages. Javascript can interperet math and logistic problems whereas HTML and CSS can not. If we want to go deeper into web development besides for reading documents, then we need to implement javascript into our programs. </p>
	<p>Another great thing about Javascript is that it can save trips back and forth while navigating through different pages of a website using the drop down menu. I am personally very excited to learn about this as I have been wondering how this has worked for a very long time!</p>

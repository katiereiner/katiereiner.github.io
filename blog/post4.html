	<h1>Pairing</h1>
	<p>Pairing with others is both challenging and helpful.</p>
	<p>There are some parts of pairing that is really challenging. For instance, keeping the roles of driver and navigator. At least for me, it is very difficult to stay in these roles in the moment when you impulsively realize that you know how to code something. However, it was also extremely helpful going through the motions with someone as it is very easy to make stupid mistakes on your own, but with somoene else, they can catch your mistakes.</p>
	<p>I did sense the vulnerability aspect when pairing and recieving feedback because as an extreme novice, I have no idea how I compare with anyone my level and what will come for me in the future. The feedback can be scary but it is obviously extremely helpful that it is coming from real programmers.</p>

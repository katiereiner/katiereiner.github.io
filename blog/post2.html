<h1>What Scares Me the Most About DBC?</h1>
<p>Many things both scare and excite me about the upcoming summer. I am so excited to meet new people and develop relationships that I wouldn't have previously been able to. Also, <strong>of course</strong> I am so excited to be able to create websites and build on my passion for technology. However, I am also <strong>scared</strong>, scared that I won't be able to retain as much as my peers that are more familiar with the material and therefore, let them down. <strong>Scared</strong> that I will lose motivation due to the long hours and difficult material. However, what has been most scary is working on DEV while at college. This has probably been one of the challenging academic things I have ever done however I know it will be rewarding.</p>

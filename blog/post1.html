<h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
<p><strong>Margins</stong> are on the outside of block elements while padding is on the inside. We use margin to separate the block from things outside it, padding to move the contents away from the edges of the block.</p>
<p><strong>Padding</strong> clears an area around the content (inside the border) of an element. The padding is affected by the background color of the element. The top, right, bottom, and left padding can be changed independently using separate properties. A shorthand padding property can also be used, to change all paddings at once.</p>
<p><strong>Borders</strong> allow you to specify the style and color of an element's border.</p>
